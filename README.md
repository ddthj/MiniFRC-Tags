# MiniFRC-Tags

MiniFRC-Tags is a small library that simplifies setup of AprilTags for MiniFRC. It is built upon OpenCV and pyAprilTags.
1/4 and 1/2 scale 36h11 tags are included in a printable PDF with IDs 1 through 16, the same standard that FRC uses.

## Dependencies
```opencv-python```

```pyapriltags```

```picamera2``` - Required only when using Raspberry Pi cameras

I have gotten away with using pip3 to install these on Linux, however on Raspberry Pi it is recommended to use `apt install python-<library>`

## Usage

- Plug in a video capture device
- Read and modify the `__init__` code in `main.py` as desired to change parameters such as image resolution, processing threads, etc.
- On the first run, the code will only calibrate your camera. Read `calibrate.py` for details on how this works.
- See example below to start your own solution, or run `example.py`

```python
minifrc_tags = MiniTags()
# On first run this generates camera.npy
# On subsequent runs it reads from camra.npy
minifrc_tags.calibrate()  

...

while True:
  tags = minifrc_tags.get_tags()
  for tag in tags:
    print(tag.tag_id)
    print(tag.pose_R)
    print(tag.pose_T)
    # todo - orient my robot to the tag!
```
