    The MiniTags class was designed to be fairly portable and simple to use.
    It handles camera calibration and tag detection with the OpenCV and pyAprilTags libraries

    get_tag() returns a list of tags currently in frame. You will care most about the following properties:
    tag.tag_id: int, The ID of the tag. FRC tags are numbered 1 thru 16
    center: numpy.ndarray, The center of the tag measured in pixel coordinates
    pose_R: Optional[numpy.ndarray], The orientation matrix of the tag
    pose_t: Optional[numpy.ndarray], Vector from the camera to the tag, in meters

    ...For simpler/faster solutions, you may want to estimate_tag_pose = False and only use pixel coordinates

        There are a couple levels of calibration available depending on what you need:

        1. Manual
        - Simply make a manual entry to self.camera_matrix instead of None
        - Good solution if you don't have a wide-angle camera lense (little distortion)
        - See comment where self.camera_matrix is defined on details

        2. Automatic
        - Takes some more setup: see the comment in calibrate_camera within calibrate.py
        - Great for correcting distortion in fisheye/wide-angle lenses
        - Only needs to be done once, a camera.npy file is created to store the settings
