    calibrate_camera creates and saves camera distortion properties to 'camera.npy'
    It will run automatically if camera.npy can't be found, but requires some setup:

    1. Print the pattern from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/doc/pattern.png
    2. Measure the size of the checker squares. They should be 22.587mm if printed without a margin
        -if your checker size is different, you can change CHECKER_SIZE in main.py
    3. Place checkerboard on a well-lit flat surface and run this program. Calibration should begin automatically
    4. Move your camera around the checkerboard to capture it at various angles
    5. If the captured data looks good, press 'Enter' to save. Otherwise, press any other key to skip
    5. Repeat until you have 10 good captures
    6. Wait (potentially several minutes) to see the undistorted video feed. If all looks good, press 'ESC' to finish
    7. If undistorted feed looks too crazy, press 'ESC' and then delete the camera.npy file to try again
